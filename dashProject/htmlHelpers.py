                            <p>Fly the data was made by <a href="https://zoohair.github.io">Zouhair Mahboubi</a> 
                            as a submission to the <a href="https://www.thedataincubator.com">Data incubator</a>. The project is based on 
                            a previous visualization project <a href="https://www.divethedata.com">Dive the Data</a> for Marine Megafauna</p>

                            <p>The route data is visualized using Plotly and Dash. 
                            The three Plotly graphs are cross graphs, meaning what you select in one graph is reflected in the other two.
                            A route map gives an overview of the origin/destination pairs. Using clustering algorithm, it is possible to get a 
                            better sense for the major traffic between the hubs<br>
                            An airlines graph gives an overview of the major airlines, and a breakdown of their passenger capacity.
                            A range graph shows a distribution of the length of flights, broken down by aircraft type.</p>

                                Unfortunately, the route data is a bit data. Aircraft performance was scrubbed 
                                from the <a href="https://contentzone.eurocontrol.int/apm/">Eurocontrol database</a>. </p>
